A dead man's switch is a mechanism that triggers when the user fails to perform an action. Using smart contracts and decentralized file storage, the project aims to make secret recovery easier. Its targeted use cases include, will & trust, password recovery, emergency communication etc. Files you place in a sarcophagus are only unlocked in the event of you failing to attest to the contract. \"\"The project uses a multi-DAO structure, with an Aragon DAO at the centre and four sub-DAOs for different operations, namely: payroll, ambassadors, liquidity and growth. The SARCO token is the primary unit of exchange in the network used to pay an Archaeologist for their resurrection services and in posting a bond by Archaeologist.\"\"How it works- Any user wanting to make sure certain information could be recovered if they were to pass away, or loose access to their account, can create a Sarcophagus and store those files inside. Storing the file inside the Sarcophagus is known as Mummifying them. When Mummifying a file through the Sarcophagus dApp the file is encrypted and uploaded to Arweave. Arweave generates a transaction ID for every transaction and every file uploaded. The user who creates the Sarcophagus is known as the Creator or Embalmer.\"\"Upon creation of the Sarcophagus, the Embalmer also sets a Recipient, a Resurrection Time and a Bounty. The Resurrection Time is the time at which, and after, the file can be decrypted again. If this time needed to be updated by the Embalmer they would then have to sign a new message with their wallet on the Sarcophagus dApp, known as Re-Wrapping, in order to extend the Resurrection Time and maintain having all their data still locked away securely and accessible only to themselves.\"\"If the Resurrection Time is reached then the Sarcophagus is eligible to be decrypted and have its contents sent to the Recipient. The recipient is set and identified by their public Ethereum address. The Bounty is what the Embalmer pays for the service. It is quoted to them when creating the Sarcophagus, after inputting all their settings. It is paid in SARCO tokens. The Sarcophagi are decrypted by the nodes (aka computers) running the Sarcophagus DAO software, known in the protocol as the Archeologists. These Archeologists are incentivised to decrypt the messages by getting rewarded with the Bounty.\"",

Bancor is the only decentralized staking protocol that allows you to earn money with single-token exposure and full protection from temporary loss.  The protocol token used on the network is the “Bancor Network Token,” BNT. The protocol’s token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Overseen by the Bancor DAO, the protocol's mission is to bring DeFi mainstream by providing the simplest and safest way to trade and earn passive income in DeFi. Bancor invented the first automated market maker (AMM) Liquidity pool in 2017. Bancor is the preferred treasury and liquidity management solution of many DAOs including Polygon, Synthetix, UMA, Paraswap, Nexus Mutual, KeeperDAO, BarnBridge & WOO Network DAO.\"",

It enables the querying of data that is challenging to query directly. Based on subgraph manifests, also referred to as subgraph descriptions, the Graph learns what and how to index Ethereum data. Anyone can create and publish subgraphs, which are open APIs that can be queried by applications using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data. With more networks on the way, the graph currently supports indexing data from IPFS, POA, and Ethereum.\"",
